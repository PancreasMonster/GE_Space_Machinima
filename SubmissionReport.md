# Description of the assignment
This assignment is a space battle machinima with an original story based on other science fictions stories such as Halo and Star Wars. It involves a short cutscene followed by a space battle ending in the destruction of the enemy flagship.

# Instructions
Just open the project and play from the PlanetScene.

# How it works
For the initial cutscene, everything is done through an IEnumerator calling functions at different times to change cameras, trigger audio sources and start particle systems. For the following scene, the Squadra's movement is done with a pathfollow script and an offset pursue. The battle around them is done through a non-ECS flocking system. Animations, directed camera shots and time specific events do the rest of the magic. I used post processing for bloom and motion blur. 

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
I am most proud of the flocking system in this project. While it is not ECS, it is quite efficient as it uses one GameObject to do most of the calculations for the flock. I used abstract classes for inheritance and scriptable objects for ease of use when changing values of different behaviours in the flock.
