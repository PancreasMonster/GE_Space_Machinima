# Game-Engines-Assignment-1
This assignment will aim to create a sci-fi machinima of a spacebattle along with other story elements, which are not based off one piece of work but instead loosely inspired from multiple sci-fi scenes. 

## The Story
The story will first begin with a spaceship heading to Moonbase Alpha, which is the last post before Yortia, the homeworld of the Yortians. This will then cut to a briefing room where an elite squad of Yortians are being informed on their next, and probably last, mission: to destroy the ultimate weapon of the enemy, a flagship capable of destroying planets from afar. A screenshop of the scene below:

After this brief, the five members of Squadra promptly leave the Moonbase on their ships, carrying the bomb needed to destroy the enemy flagship with them. As they are flying away however, the Moonbase is blown up in one fiery explosion. They continue to make their way to the enemy flagship and as they approach it, a large scale Space Battle between the final Yortian forces and the enemy ships has taken place around it. Squadra must weave through the battle and reach their quarry. All but one of them are destroyed but only one ship is needed to destroy the flagship. The Yortians will live to see another day.
